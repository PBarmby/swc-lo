01
    *Explain what a library is, and what libraries are used for.
    *Load a Python library and use the things it contains.
    *Read tabular data from a file into a program.
    *Assign values to variables.
    *Select individual values and subsections from data.
    *Perform operations on arrays of data.
    *Display simple graphs.
02
> *   Explain what a for loop does.
> *   Correctly write for loops to repeat simple calculations.
> *   Trace changes to a loop variable as the loop runs.
> *   Trace changes to other variables as they are updated by a for loop.
> *   Explain what a list is.
> *   Create and index lists of simple values.
> *   Use a library function to get a list of filenames that match a simple wildcard pattern.

> *   Write conditional statements including `if`, `elif`, and `else` branches.
> *   Correctly evaluate expressions containing `and` and `or`.

04
> *   Define a function that takes parameters.
> *   Return a value from a function.
> *   Test and debug a function.
> *   Set default values for function parameters.

05

> *   Explain what an assertion is.
> *   Add assertions that check the program's state is correct.
> *   Correctly add precondition and postcondition assertions to functions.
> *   Explain what test-driven development is, and use it when creating new functions.
> *   Explain why variables should be initialized using actual data values rather than arbitrary constants.
> *   Debug code containing an error systematically.

06
> *   Use the values of command-line arguments in a program.
> *   Handle flags and files separately in a command-line program.
> *   Read data from standard input in a program so that it can be used in a pipeline.

07
> *   To be able to read a traceback, and determine the following relevant pieces of information:
>     * The file, function, and line number on which the error occurred
>     * The type of the error
>     * The error message
> *   To be able to describe the types of situations in which the following errors occur:
>     * `SyntaxError` and `IndentationError`
>     * `NameError`
>     * `KeyError` and `IndexError`
>     * `IOError`
