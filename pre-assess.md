write a program from scratch that reads a column of numbers 
from a text file and calculates mean and standard deviation of that data?

A tab-delimited file has two columns showing the date and the highest temperature on that day. 
Write a program to produce a graph showing the average highest temperature for each month.

Given the URL for a project's version control repository, check out a working copy 
of that project, add a file called notes.txt, and commit the change.

Given a 200-line function to test, write half a dozen tests using a unit testing framework 
and use code coverage to check that they exercise every line of the function.

A database has two tables Scientist and Lab. Scientist's columns are the scientist's user ID, name, and email address; Lab's columns are lab IDs, 
lab names, and scientist IDs. Write an SQL statement that outputs the count of the number of scientists in each lab.

How would you solve this problem? A directory contains 1000 text files. 
Create a list of all files that contain the word "Drosophila" and save the result to a file called results.txt.
